Here is a list of all the parts I used, along with where I sourced them from and the price at the time I purchased them. Everything I purchased was based on the size of my project, if you intend to build this yourself, make sure you order your parts based on how big you want the final product to be. All listed costs are from time of purchase, not including tax or shipping.

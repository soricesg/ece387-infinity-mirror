#summary Instructions with photos on how everything came together

= Introduction =

First things first, make sure after you have recieved all of your electronics that you wire them up in a controlled environment and test them. My suggestion would be as follows:

Test arduino, LED strip, LPD8806 library and supplied test code and the power supply. 
Test Ping ultrasonic distance sensor ensuring that it returns an accurate distance.
Test toggle switches ensuring that the arduino recognizes 00, 01, 10, and 11.

= Assemble the VU Meter =

If you chose to order the VU Meter from vumeterkit.com, you should have everything you need in the kit except for the power supply and any audio hook up wires. You can assemble this based on the instructions provided [http://vumeterkit.com/assembly/ here].

Once you have it all assembled, I would suggest hooking up an audio source and power supply and ensuring it lights up as expected. (Yay more testing!)

= Assemble the enclosure =

Use the acrylic cement purchased from Tapplastics and put the edges and rear (standard) mirror together. Follow this video on [http://www.tapplastics.com/product_info/videos/how_to_glue_acrylic how to cement acrylic together]. Ensure that you leave the two way mirror off, that way you can still place the led strip and any other internal electronics if you chose to add to my design.

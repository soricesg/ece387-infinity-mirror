# Introduction #

First things first, make sure after you have recieved all of your electronics that you wire them up in a controlled environment and test them. My suggestion would be as follows:

Test arduino, LED strip, LPD8806 library and supplied test code and the power supply.
Test Ping ultrasonic distance sensor ensuring that it returns an accurate distance.
Test toggle switches ensuring that the arduino recognizes 00, 01, 10, and 11.

# Assemble the VU Meter #

If you chose to order the VU Meter from vumeterkit.com, you should have everything you need in the kit except for the power supply and any audio hook up wires. You can assemble this based on the instructions provided [here](http://vumeterkit.com/assembly/).

Once you have it all assembled, I would suggest hooking up an audio source and power supply and ensuring it lights up as expected. (Yay more testing!)

# Assemble the enclosure #

Use the acrylic cement purchased from Tapplastics and put the edges and rear (standard) mirror together. Follow this video on [how to cement acrylic together](http://www.tapplastics.com/product_info/videos/how_to_glue_acrylic). Ensure that you leave the two way mirror off, that way you can still place the led strip and any other internal electronics if you chose to add to my design.

Once you've got the enclosure assembled short of the two way mirror, you're now ready to place your (tested) led strip around internal edges of the enclosure, as close to the rear mirror as possible. I used silicon to secure the strip in place, but feel free to use whatever adhesive you prefer. At this point you can now cement the front mirror into place, however before doing so I suggest once again wiring up the led strip to ensure that nothing went wrong because once the front mirror is cemented into place, you will have a very hard time getting access to the led strip again.

# Structural Support, VU Meter and Ping Placement #

Once the enclosure is ready to go, cut four pieces of square acrylic tube to be the height of the enclosure. Two will be used externally to house the LEDs for the VU Meter, the other two will be used internally as structural supports.

In the two that will be used for the VU Meter, drill 10 holes into each at whatever spacing you prefer, and feed the LEDs up into those holes. I also drilled holes into the black sign acrylic of the sides to be able to feed all of those wires through into the extra space behind both mirrors so that all my wires would be contained and organized. Once thats done, attach those tubes to external sides of the enclosure. I placed them at the very front (flush with the two way mirror).

Take the other two tubes,and attach them internally anywhere you think the enclosure may not be structurally sound. I chose the corners at the back edge.

Now that you've got everything setup, take a piece of acrylic tube (24 inches in length) and drill holes for the two switches as well as the wires for the ping sensor. Again space them however you see fit, I centered the ping and tried to place the switches about centered between the ends and the ping. Again attach this with the acrylic cement, at the top rear edge of the enclosure.

At this point, everything should be done, wire it all up and see how it works!

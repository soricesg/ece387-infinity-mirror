# Summary #

In terms of the requirements for the course, the project has been successfully completed, however I added some additional functionality (the VU Meter) that is still a work in progress. Something went wrong with my soldering and only half of the circuit works, so once I get the chance I'm going to have to take that portion apart and see whats going on with it.

# Goals #

Some future goals for the Infinity mirror include the following:
  * Syncing the LED strips to music (Most likely with a spectrum analyzer chip and some fancy code!)
  * More functions for the LEDs to make better effects.
  * Finishing up the placement of the square acrylic tubing so that I'll be able to wall mount the Mirror.

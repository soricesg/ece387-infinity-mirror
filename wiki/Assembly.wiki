#summary Instructions with photos on how everything came together

= Introduction =

First things first, make sure after you have recieved all of your electronics that you wire them up in a controlled environment and test them. My suggestion would be as follows:

Test arduino, LED strip, LPD8806 library and supplied test code and the power supply. 
Test Ping ultrasonic distance sensor ensuring that it returns an accurate distance.
Test toggle switches ensuring that the arduino recognizes 00, 01, 10, and 11.

= Assemble the enclosure =

Since nothing else can be done until the enclosure is put together and secure, I would suggest doing this first. Use the acrylic cement purchased from Tapplastics and put the edges and rear (standard) mirror together.

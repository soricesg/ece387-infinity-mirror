Individual final project for Miami University Embedded Systems Design (ECE 387). This project is controlled using an Arduino Uno [R3](https://code.google.com/p/ece387-infinity-mirror/source/detail?r=3). For this project, I used black sign acrylic used for the sides, top and bottom. Acrylic standard and two way mirror used for front and back of the enclosure respectively. 2 meters of  RGB led strip cut to size, with power supply. Using code supplied by Adafruit for the basics, and modified and improved for my own uses on an Arduino Uno [R3](https://code.google.com/p/ece387-infinity-mirror/source/detail?r=3).
